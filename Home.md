# Welcome to the tickets-management-web wiki!

## Purpose of the app
This app is designed to help streamlining the process of managing and solving issues (tickets) in a simple way.   
Here "issues" means any problem which can be noticed by an actor, must be reported in details, and then worked on to be solved. 
      
_Why not simply use a spreadsheet?_ Well, that's an excellent question. This would be our answer: because a spreadsheet does not allow you to notify the different actors involved in the process of solving an issue about the progress made on that issue. If you don't go to the spreadsheet, you won't know what has happened. This is bascically why this app is born.   
In addition, spreadsheets quickly show their limits in terms of separating tickets by groups or projects in a user-friendly way, managing the process required to process a ticket, logging the activity around the tickets and providing dashboards summarising this activity. Maybe one day this app will do all of this.
